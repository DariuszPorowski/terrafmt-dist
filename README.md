# terrafmt distributiuon

Distribution repository for [terrafmt](https://github.com/katbyte/terrafmt) pre-compiled binaries. A manual GitHub Actions workflow pulls the latest upstream release from [terrafmt](https://github.com/katbyte/terrafmt/releases), builds multi-platform archives with GoReleaser, and publishes them here using the same tag (skipping if the tag already exists).
